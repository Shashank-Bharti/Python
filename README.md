This project is inspired by the amazing course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@JhIateUBMf7e7EIGbWklj_wkQAwshJd8TCein_JVFb0KRFC3rDEPz218Ur2Agz-NrA==/) on Udemy.
A huge thank you to Angela for creating such an engaging and well-structured course — it’s been a game-changer in my coding journey!
